App::Control
============

Description
-----------

App::Control is a simple module to replicate the kind of
functionality you get with apachectl to control apache, but
for any script or executable. There is a very simple OO
interface, where the constructor is used to specify the
executable, command line arguments, and pidfile, and various
methods (start, stop, etc.) are used to control the
executable in the obvious way.

Installation
------------

The usual ...

> perl Makefile.PL
> make
[ > make test ]
> make install
